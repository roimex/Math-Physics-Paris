### Theme
Some Spectral Theory Problems in Condensed Matter Physics

### Abstract
In this talk, I will discuss some fundamental spectral theory problems arising from recent studies in condensed matter physics. The main topics include the spectral structure of periodic operators on \mathbb{R}^n, as well as the study of magic angles and flat bands in models of twisted bilayer graphene, which provide a particularly interesting class of periodic operators.
