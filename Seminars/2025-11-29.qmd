### Theme
Quantum Groups as Global Symmetries (1)

### Abstract
In this talk, I will give an introductory overview of quantum field theories whose global symmetries are described by quantum groups rather than ordinary groups. I will explain why operators in such theories often become non-local and can be understood as endpoints of topological line operators. Using a simple example with $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ symmetry, we will see how quantum groups constrain correlation functions and how these ideas help solve the model.
