### Theme
An Introduction to Studying 3D CFTs on the Fuzzy Sphere

### Abstract
Conformal field theories are central to modern condensed matter and high energy physics. Their solutions in space-time dimensions higher than two remain challenging. The fuzzy sphere regularisation is a recently-proposed method to address this problem. In this talk, I will introduce how fuzzy sphere helps studying CFTs in 3D through the simplest example of the 3D Ising CFT. I will then review its development since the proposal. This talk will be partly based on arXiv:2503.00100.
