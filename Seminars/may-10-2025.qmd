### Theme
Topological K-theory

### Abstract
We began by focusing on topological K-theory for topological spaces, aiming to clarify its foundational concepts and derive several essential properties. We then explored algebraic K-theory for $C^*$-algebras and compared it with topological K-theory through concrete examples. Finally, we introduced the notion of “spectrum–algebra correspondence” to establish an intuitive connection between the two theories.
