### Theme
On Boundary Conditions and Phases of Quantum Field Theories

### Abstract
In this lecture, I will discuss how to access the homotopy type of the space of boundary conditions of quantum field theories. In the process, I will generalize Witten's work relating Morse theory and supersymmetric quantum mechanics to higher dimensions, demonstrating that supersymmetric boundary conditions in certain higher-dimensional sigma models are classified by generalized homology theories. As an application, we show that this new invariant can be used to distinguish infrared massive phases.
