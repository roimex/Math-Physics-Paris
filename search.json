    "text": "Iñaki García-Etxebarria, Miguel Montero\n\n\nAnomalies can be elegantly analyzed by means of the Dai–Freed theorem. In this framework it is natural to consider a refinement of traditional anomaly cancellation conditions, which sometimes leads to nontrivial extra constraints in the fermion spectrum. We analyze these more refined anomaly cancellation conditions in a variety of theories of physical interest, including the Standard Model and the \\(SU(5)\\) and \\(Spin(10)\\) GUTs, which we find to be anomaly free. Turning to discrete symmetries, we find that baryon triality has a \\(\\mathbb{Z}_9\\) anomaly that only cancels if the number of generations is a multiple of 3. Assuming the existence of certain anomaly-free \\(\\mathbb{Z}_4\\) symmetry we relate the fact that there are 16 fermions per generation of the Standard Model — including right-handed neutrinos — to anomalies under time-reversal of boundary states in four-dimensional topological superconductors. A similar relation exists for the MSSM, only this time involving the number of gauginos and Higgsinos, and it is non-trivially, and remarkably, satisfied for the \\(SU(3) \\times SU(2) \\times U(1)\\) gauge group with two Higgs doublets. We relate the constraints we find to the well-known Ibáñez–Ross ones, and discuss the dependence on UV data of the construction. Finally, we comment on the (non-)existence of K-theoretic \\(\\theta\\) angles in four dimensions.\n\n\n\nDai-Freed Anomalies in Particle Physics (Iñaki García-Etxebarria, Miguel Montero)"

The main result was announced in [6] and, for manifolds with boundary, in [5]. The long delay between these announcements and the present paper is due to several factors. On the one hand, a fairly detailed exposition has already appeared in [14]. On the other hand, our original proof, reproduced with minor modifications in [14], had a number of drawbacks. In the first place the use of cobordism, and the computational checking associated with this, were not very enlightening. More seriously, however, the method of proof did not lend itself to certain natural generalizations of the problem where appropriate cobordism groups were not known. The reader who is familiar with the Riemann–Roch theorem will realize that our original proof of the index theorem was modelled closely on Hirzebruch’s proof of the Riemann–Roch theorem. Naturally enough we were led to look for a proof modelled more on that of Grothendieck. While we have not completely succeeded in this aim, we have at least found a proof which is much more natural, does not use cobordism, and lends itself therefore to generalization. In spirit, at least, it has much in common with Grothendieck’s approach.\n\n\n\nThe Index of Elliptic Operators I (M. F. Atiyah, I. M. Singer)"
