The Math-Physics Paris discussion group focuses on symmetries in modern physics, exploring their fundamental roles and recent developments across CMT, HEP and mathematical physics. It is inspried by and aligned with the theme of the [2024 IHES Summer School](https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/event/11080/).

## Organization
