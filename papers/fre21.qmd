## Author

Daniel S. Freed

### Abstract
The Atiyah-Singer index theorem, a landmark achievement of the early 1960s, brings
together ideas in analysis, geometry, and topology. We recount some antecedents and motivations; various forms of the theorem; and some of its implications, which extend to the present.
