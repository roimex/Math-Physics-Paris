1.⁠ ⁠What is the anomaly of 4d Weyl fermion with charge $q$ under $U(1)$ global symmetry?

2.⁠ ⁠What is  the anomaly of 4d Weyl fermion with representation as doublet under $U(2)$ global symmetry?

3.⁠ ⁠What is  the anomaly of 4d Weyl fermion with N-representation as N-multiplet under $U(N)$ global symmetry?
