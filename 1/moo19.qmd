Gregory W. Moore

### Abstract
These are lecture notes for a series of talks at the 2019 TASI school. They contain introductory material to the general subject of Chern-Simons theory. They are meant to be elementary and pedagogical. These notes are still in Preparation. Constructive comments are very welcome. (In particular, I have not been systematic about trying to include references. The literature is huge and I know my own work best. I will certainly be interested if people bring reference omissions to my attention.)
