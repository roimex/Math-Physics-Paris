However, it can still suffer from a mixed gravitational anomaly, hypothetically pertinent to leptogenesis in the very early universe. This happens when the total “sterile right-handed” neutrino number \\(n_{\\nu_R}\\) is not equal to the family number \\(N_f\\). Thus the invertible \\(\\mathbf{B} - \\mathbf{L}\\) symmetry current conservation can be violated quantum mechanically by gravitational backgrounds such as gravitational instantons. In specific, we show that a noninvertible categorical \\(\\mathbf{B} - \\mathbf{L}\\) generalized symmetry still survives in gravitational backgrounds. In general, we propose a construction of noninvertible symmetry charge operators as topological defects derived from invertible anomalous symmetries that suffer from mixed gravitational anomalies. Examples include the perturbative local and nonperturbative global anomalies classified by \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{16}\\) respectively. For this construction, we utilize the anomaly inflow bulk-boundary correspondence, the 4d Pontryagin class and the gravitational Chern-Simons 3-form, the 3d Witten–Reshetikhin–Turaev-type topological quantum field theory with a framing anomaly corresponding to a 2d rational conformal field theory with an appropriate rational chiral central charge, and the 4d \\(\\mathbb{Z}_4^{\\mathrm{TF}}\\)-time-reversal symmetric topological superconductor with 3d boundary topological order.\n\n\n\nCategorical Symmetry of the Standard Model from Gravitational Anomaly (Pavel Putrov, Juven Wang)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Pavel Putrov, Juven Wang\n\n\nIn the Standard Model, some combination of the baryon \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) and lepton \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) number symmetry is free of mixed anomalies with strong and electroweak \\(su(3) \\times su(2) \\times u(1)_{\\tilde{Y}}\\) gauge forces. However, it can still suffer from a mixed gravitational anomaly, hypothetically pertinent to leptogenesis in the very early universe. This happens when the total “sterile right-handed” neutrino number \\(n_{\\nu_R}\\) is not equal to the family number \\(N_f\\). Thus the invertible \\(\\mathbf{B} - \\mathbf{L}\\) symmetry current conservation can be violated quantum mechanically by gravitational backgrounds such as gravitational instantons. In specific, we show that a noninvertible categorical \\(\\mathbf{B} - \\mathbf{L}\\) generalized symmetry still survives in gravitational backgrounds. In general, we propose a construction of noninvertible symmetry charge operators as topological defects derived from invertible anomalous symmetries that suffer from mixed gravitational anomalies. Examples include the perturbative local and nonperturbative global anomalies classified by \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{16}\\) respectively. For this construction, we utilize the anomaly inflow bulk-boundary correspondence, the 4d Pontryagin class and the gravitational Chern-Simons 3-form, the 3d Witten–Reshetikhin–Turaev-type topological quantum field theory with a framing anomaly corresponding to a 2d rational conformal field theory with an appropriate rational chiral central charge, and the 4d \\(\\mathbb{Z}_4^{\\mathrm{TF}}\\)-time-reversal symmetric topological superconductor with 3d boundary topological order.\n\n\n\nCategorical Symmetry of the Standard Model from Gravitational Anomaly (Pavel Putrov, Juven Wang)"

    "text": "Ran Luo\n\n\nSPT Construction\n\n\n\nWe began by introducing the Lieb-Robinson bound, which provides estimates on the correlations between local operators in lattice systems, thereby motivating the notion of a causal light cone on the lattice. We then defined quasi-local unitary operators and discussed their implementation complexity in terms of quantum circuits. Building on these concepts, we explored the definition of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, characterized by whether each quantum gate respects the underlying symmetry. Finally, we examined the cluster chain model as a concrete example of an SPT phase, analyzed its decorated domain-wall structure, and connected it to projective representations, thereby establishing a classification scheme for bosonic SPT phases.\n\n\n\nVideo 2025-05-17\n\n\n\nNotes 2025-05-17\n\n\n\n\nLocal unitary transformation, long-range quantum entanglement, wave function renormalization, and topological order (Xie Chen, Zheng-Cheng Gu, and Xiao-Gang Wen)\nLocality in Quantum Systems (Matthew B.

We then introduced several common types of characteristic classes, including the Chern class, Todd class, Pontryagin class, and Euler class, highlighting their key properties. Following that, we presented the most general form of the Atiyah–Singer Index Theorem and explained its broad applications in physics. In particular, by introducing the \\(\\hat{A}-genus\\) (A-roof genus), we gained a deeper understanding of how the index theorem manifests in the case of the Dirac operator.\n\n\nVideo\nVideo 2025-04-19\n\n\nNotes\nNotes 2025-04-19\n\n\nResources\n\nGeometry, Topology and Physics (Mikio Nakahara)"
