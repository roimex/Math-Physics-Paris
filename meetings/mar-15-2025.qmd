### Theme 
Axiomatic construction of TQFT

### Abstract
In this session, we began by exploring the boundaries in topological quantum field theory (TQFT), followed by a review of the notion of quantum anomalies and their implications. We then discussed how invariants can be described in a more axiomatic framework. The session continued with an investigation into boundary invariants and spin structures.
