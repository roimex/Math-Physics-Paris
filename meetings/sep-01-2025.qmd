### Theme
Introduction to Clifford algebra

### Abstract
This talk is devoted to the basic algebraic ingredients of spin geometry: Clifford
algebras and spin groups. Clifford algebras are naturally associated to vector spaces
endowed with symmetric bilinear forms. The Clifford algebra of the n-dimensional
Euclidean space contains the spin group $Spin(n)$, which is the 2-fold cover of the
special orthogonal group $SO(n)$ for $n \ge 3$. We study the concept of Clifford algebras and
highlight some of their important properties.
