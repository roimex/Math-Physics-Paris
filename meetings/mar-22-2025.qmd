### Theme
Basic Concepts of Higher-form Symmetries

### Abstract
Starting from the Ward identity, we rephrased several well-known results using differential forms and topological operators. This reformulation helped highlight the key structural features required for generalizing to higher-form symmetries.

### Theme
Yang-Mills Theory

### Abstract
We began with the foundational definitions of principal bundles and explored the associated notions of connection and curvature. Building on this framework, we introduced the Yang–Mills action within the context of gauge theory and discussed its physical and mathematical significance.
